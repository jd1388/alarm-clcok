# Alarm Clock
This is a WIP alarm clock application built with React and Material UI.

## Setup
In order to run this app, [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) is required. This has been developed using version 10.9.0.

To install dependencies, go into `frontend`, then run `npm i`.

## Running the Frontend
While inside the `frontend` directory, run `npm run start`. This will spin up a local development server, and our browser should open to [localhost:3000](localhost:3000).

## Running Frontend Tests
To run the tests for the frontend, from the `frontend` directory, run `npm run jest`. This will start Jest. It will give instructions from the terminal on how to run tests. To run all tests, press `a`.
